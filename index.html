<p><em>Fabulists are fable-spinners and myth-makers. We are storytellers ourselves, but we poke holes in the hype and distortion of new digital technologies and the narratives associated with them. Contrafabulists are, as the name would suggest, against lying.</em></p>

<h3>About The Contrafabulists Trails</h3>
<br />
<p>In the summer of 2022 we discovered the <a href="https://www.coastal.ca.gov/access/ca-coastal-trail/coastal-trail.pdf">California Coastal Trail</a>, an ambitious project out of the State of California to have a trail you could walk from the Oregon border to the border of Mexico, all along the California coastline. We were doing our now annual hike in Southern Oregon of Kerby Peak, and while in Crescent City, we discovered the <a href="https://www.coastal.ca.gov/">California Coastal Commission</a> and the resulting trail work they have been doing. We found ourselves thinking and talking about this trail for the next couple of months.</p>
<p>This subdomain under our Contrafabulists brand is the result of these discussions, and we are now dedicated to exploring, documenting, and bringing more attention to this trail. This site is dedicated to us exploring this topic. We will be publishing photos, stories, and other data and information we gather along the way. We aren't sure where we are headed with this work, but we are convinced that our future will involve the California Coastal Trail. The trail calls to us, and we feel like walking this beautiful stretch of America is one of the most important things we can be doing in the future. </p>
