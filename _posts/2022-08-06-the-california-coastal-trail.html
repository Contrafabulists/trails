<p>We learned about the <a href="https://www.coastal.ca.gov/access/ca-coastal-trail/coastal-trail.pdf">California Coastal Trail</a>, and the <a href="https://www.coastal.ca.gov/">California Coastal Commission</a> after our now annual hike to the top of Kerby Peak in Southern Oregon. To break up our trip, and do some of the hikes we did with the Kid back in 2016, we stopped in Crescent City, CA. While hiking in between our hotel and eating establishments in Crescent City, we stumbled across sections of the California Coastal Trail along the water front. </p>

<p>As daily walkers, we were captivated by the idea of the trail. Of the 1230 miles of coastline, there are about 875 miles of California Coastal Trail completed. While other trails like the Pacific Crest Trail, which you can hike from Mexico to Canada are appealing, we really love California, and specifically the California coastline. As we went home in June of 2022 we found ourselves thinking and talking about the possibilities surrounding the trail.</p> 
  
<p>After discussing the possibilities we decided to explore ideas for investing more exploration the California Coastal Trail, as well as the towns and coast line along it. We love walking, and we’ve been doing inn to inn hikes along the coast where we stay in motels and hike different sections. The California Coastal Trail would give us an opportunity to get to know official sections of the trail, while also getting to know where the trail was incomplete.</p>
  
<p>We aren’t sure what the plan is yet, and we have lots of exploration to do before we know exactly what this is all about. We are beginning with a different section of the trail each month, staying in and exploring the various communities, parks, and other locations along the way. We’ll share our journey here, and openly explore what is next. Right now, we are just excited to have a focus that isn’t all about technology, and is about better connecting with the real world around us.</p>
